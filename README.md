This code is for a simple To-Do List web application built using HTML, Tailwind CSS (via CDN), and vanilla JavaScript. Here’s a description of the main parts:

1. HTML Structure:

The page uses a modern, responsive layout with a centered container.
At the top is a heading "My To-Do List".
There’s an input box and an "Add Task" button for users to enter new tasks.
Below, a scrollable list displays all the tasks.

2. CSS & Styling:

Tailwind CSS utility classes handle the majority of the styling, providing a clean, modern look.
A small amount of custom CSS is included for styling the scrollbar and setting up the main layout (font, background, centering, etc.).
Google Fonts is used for the "Inter" font.

3. JavaScript Functionality:

Adds tasks: When the user enters text and clicks "Add Task" (or presses Enter), a new task item is appended to the list.
Each task item:
Displays the task text.
Can be marked as completed by clicking the text (toggles a strikethrough and dims the text).
Has "Edit" and "Delete" buttons that appear on hover:
"Edit" lets the user modify the task via a prompt and resets completion status.
"Delete" removes the task from the list.
Provides feedback if the user tries to add an empty task (highlighting the input box in red and showing a message).
Summary:
This code creates a visually appealing, interactive to-do list app where users can add, complete, edit, and delete tasks, all in the browser without any need for a backend or external storage. The UI is modern thanks to Tailwind CSS, and all logic is handled by JavaScript within the HTML file.
